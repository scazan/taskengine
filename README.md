# taskengine
Uses a simple json file so it can be consumed via a number of other interfaces (command line, phone, web, etc) . Supports subtasks, deadlines, single subtasks assigned to multiple tasks, and all the normal things a task manager does.


For a command line interface that uses this system, see: https://github.com/scazan/task

Can be installed as a dependency via:
```
npm install taskengine
```
